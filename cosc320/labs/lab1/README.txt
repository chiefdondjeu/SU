(a) The time complexity for Bubble sort as the array size increase are: best case O(n) and worst case O(n^2). The time complexity for Insertion sort as the array size increase are: best case O(n) and worst case O(n^2). The time complexity for selection sort as the array size increase are: best case and worst case are both O(n^2).

(b) The absolute timing and number of elements are directly proportionals. As the number of elements in the array increase, the time is takes to sort the array increase as well, and this can be rectified with the data collected. The absolute timing is not affected by the size of the elements, and it cannot be rectified with the data collected. 
  
(d) For Bubble sort only, my average case performed worst than the worst case. Apart from this, both the average and worst cases for the other sorts were very similar. Originally I planned to also collect data for 1 million elements but bubble sort for average case took over 30 minutes and I lost patience.

(e) In order to make my program better, I could have used the best versions of the sorts.  I could have made the program have preset number of elements instead of prompting the user for the size, thus making the program less breakable and only used to collect the data. I could have also made the output look more appealingly to the eyes, so its easy and quick to collect data.
