In “The Tornado Collects Animals” by Catherine Pierce, we are introduced to a tornado that likes the attention it receives from animals. The tornado likes the animals because they fear him and truly acknowledge the tornado’s strength. As the tornado passes by, he pities the animals because they were abandoned outside by the humans, which leads to him assembling them all and have them experience what their owners could not provide to them. Usually, when one thinks of a tornado, a sense of fear is involved but Pierce attempts to show that the tornado is not to be feared by using a meaningful title and poem structure, talking from a third-person perspective, and using personification and imagery.
